Name: aeif_cond_alpha -  Conductance based exponential integrate-and-fire neuron
                         model according to Brette and Gerstner (2005).

Description:
aeif_cond_alpha is the adaptive exponential integrate and fire neuron according
to Brette and Gerstner (2005).
Synaptic conductances are modelled as alpha-functions.

This implementation uses the embedded 4th order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg solver with
adaptive step size to integrate the differential equation.

The membrane potential is given by the following differential equation:
C dV/dt= -g_L(V-E_L)+g_L*Delta_T*exp((V-V_T)/Delta_T)-g_e(t)(V-E_e)
                                                     -g_i(t)(V-E_i)-w +I_e

and

tau_w * dw/dt= a(V-E_L) -W

Integration parameters
  gsl_error_tol  double - This parameter controls the admissible error of the
                          GSL integrator. Reduce it if NEST complains about
                          numerical instabilities.
