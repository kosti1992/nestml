Name: iaf_cond_exp_implicit - Simple conductance based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
                              model.

Description:
iaf_cond_exp is an implementation of a spiking neuron using IAF dynamics with
conductance-based synapses. Incoming spike events induce a post-synaptic change
of conductance modelled by an exponential function. The exponential function
is normalised such that an event of weight 1.0 results in a peak conductance of
1 nS.

Sends: SpikeEvent

Receives: SpikeEvent, CurrentEvent, DataLoggingRequest
